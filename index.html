<h3>Bio</h3>
</p><strong>School Life</strong></p> <p>My school life is more just about learning and political stuff. I try and keep my grades up and high.
I usually keep politics out of certain classes EXCEPT civics class. I also try and keep out of fights. That can get hard though</p>
<p><strong>Personal Life</strong></p> <p> I have lived in the suberbs of Clinton Utah for almost 15 years. I play both acoustic guitar and electric guitar.
  I work on old cars and trucks, I can be asked pretty much all the things about cars and I can answer pretty much all of it. My current project is a
  1974 Chevy Cheyenne Super 20 with a 1969 350 stroker out of one of the California Highway Patrol interceptors. My truck has an incercepting engine.
  The C20 also has a Turbo 350 transmission with BorgWarner 14 bolt rear end and 4.65 gears.The other project me and my grandpa are workin on is a
  1966 Chevy Impala Super Sport, with a Canadian 327 small block. Along with a 2 speed powerglide. Very awesome car when we get er runnin   <p>
